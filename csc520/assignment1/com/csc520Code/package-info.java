        <td>To implement the code-based equivalent of a UML class
            diagram. The UML diagram depicts three seperate classes<br>
            that have an aggregated relationship. The three classes are
            Card, Deck, and Hand. Deck and Hand are dependent on<br>
            Card but are not aware of each other. All attributes and
            operations are implemented along with other hidden basics<br>
            in order to get everything hooked up and running i.e.
            construction, facilitation, and inspection needs.
