Most projects were planned, written and managed from beginning to completion by I, Christian Carreras with the exception of some files being required for my files to work properly. All projects were completed at Kutztown University of Pennsylvania for course credit from August 2012 to May 2018. Descriptions of courses and projects will be included where necessary.

A higher course number generally represents a more recent and difficult course/project
Course numbers < 400 represent undergrad courses, course numbers >= 400 represent grad courses
