\section{File List}
Here is a list of all files with brief descriptions:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{client_8cpp}{client.cpp} (This file acts as client and prompts the user for input. The prompt will accept either two floating-\/point numbers or the words 'total' or 'exit'. All input will be written to a pipe to be received by the server. The server will process the information sent and send a message back in response. The client will then display the message from the server and start the prompt again until the user enters 'exit'. All errors dealing with read and write are being accounted for with the use of perror (stderr) )}{\pageref{client_8cpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{p2_8cpp}{p2.cpp} (This project aims to replicate a client/server environment by using concurrent processes and IPC mechanisms. The client and server will each have their separate process as well as their own read and write ends from two separate pipes. To start, two pipes are created and then a second process is forked to separate the client and server. The client is the parent process and the server is the child. Each process will close the pipe ends that they will never use. The server will redirect its pipe ends to stdin and stdout and then exec while the client will send the file descriptors for the pipe ends being used as arguments in the exec function. All errors with pipes, forks, and execs are being accounted for with the use of perror (stderr) )}{\pageref{p2_8cpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{server_8cpp}{server.cpp} (This file represents a server and communicates with a client file wia pipes redirected towards stdin and stdout. The pipe will receive messages from the client letting the server know what commands to run. If the client sends two floating-\/point numbers then a message consisting of the sum, difference, product, and quotient of both numbers is sent. The two numbers are then saved in a binary file for further use. If the client sends the string 'TOTAL' then a message holding the sum of every number entered to to the server will be sent. Last if the client sends the string 'EXIT' then a message comprised of every pair of of floating point numbers is sent )}{\pageref{server_8cpp}}{}
