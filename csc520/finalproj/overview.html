        <td>To fully implement the code-based equivalent of a system specified
            in an analysis and subsystem diagram. Data is persistent<br>
            and can be added to and deleted at any time of system operation.
            The system allows members to log in and perform multiple tasks.<br>
            Members can view their account details, borrowed books, reservations,
            change their password and make a reservation. Both members<br>
            and non-members can browse and search through the catalog.
            A client is provided for integration testing of all subsystems.
