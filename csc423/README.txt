CSC 423 - Game Development for Computer Scientists II
Mr. Thiep Pham
Kutztown University
Spring 2017

This course is a continuation of the subject matter of CSC 320, Games for Computer Scientists. In CSC 320 we cover the basics of game development from concept to storyboard to low-tech prototype to implementation using a game engine. In this course we will continue our study of game engines and look at some of the more advanced features of this game engine. We will be examining animation techniques, 3D modeling, rigging, gravity, and artificial intelligence. The student will implement at least two original games using these aspects of game development.
