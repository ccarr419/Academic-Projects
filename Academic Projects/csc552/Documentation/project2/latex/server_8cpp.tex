This file represents a server and communicates with a client file wia pipes redirected towards stdin and stdout. The pipe will receive messages from the client letting the server know what commands to run. If the client sends two floating-\/point numbers then a message consisting of the sum, difference, product, and quotient of both numbers is sent. The two numbers are then saved in a binary file for further use. If the client sends the string 'TOTAL' then a message holding the sum of every number entered to to the server will be sent. Last if the client sends the string 'EXIT' then a message comprised of every pair of of floating point numbers is sent.

$\ast$ Function Name: findFileSize Function Type: facilitator Parameters: FILE$\ast$ -\/ import only -\/ file to find the size of Return Value: long -\/ the size of the file in bytes

findFileSize takes a single file reference as a argument. It takes the file reference and fseeks to the end of the file. From there ftell can be called to receive how many bytes are in the file. Since a char is only 1 byte, this number represents how many characters are in the file as well. Once the file size is found, fseek back to the beginning of the file for reading/writing.

194         long lSize = ftell(nFile); //returns number of bytes up to current fseek

$\ast$ Function Name: findTotal Function Type: facilitator Parameters: char\mbox{[}\mbox{]} -\/ import only -\/ string carrying the numbers to add Return Value: int -\/ the sum of all the numbers read

findTotal takes a single cstring (char array) as an argument. The argument acts as a message container to search through. With the help of strtok, this function will iterate through every number in the message container with \char`\"{}space\char`\"{} being the delimiter. strtok cycles through each number until the pointer returns is NULL, meaning it has run out of numbers indicating the end of file. Each iteration the number strtok is pointing to in converted into a float and added to sum to be returned. Once every number is added to the sum then the total sum is returned.

209         int total = 0; //Sum of all numbers

$\ast$ Function Name: printEquations Function Type: facilitator Parameters: string -\/ import only -\/ number 1 in string form string -\/ import only -\/ number 2 in string form Return Value: void

printEquations takes two string arguments. Both string arguments are immediately converted into floats so basic mathematical operations can be performed on them. First the first row is formatted and written to display what operation the number represents. The second is formatted the same as the first but displays the results of the operation above. Everything is formatted and written to stdout independently. Every column will have a set width of 15 characters and be displayed with left justification in the column. Numbers are to be displayed with a precision of 10.

shutDownServer takes a single file reference argument. The file reference argument is to be closed in order to return system resources. The pipes are flushed of all contents and are closed. Since the server's pipe ends are stdin and stdout, they are closed respectively.

toFloat takes a single string argument to convert into a float. First the string is inserted into a stringstream for holding. Then the stream is extracted into a temporary holding floating-\/point number. The floating point number is then returned as the functions return value.

writeToFile takes two string arguments and a single file reference argument. The strings will be numbers to be inserted into the file. The numbers are written to the file individually to avoid packaging. A space character is written between the numbers and after the last number to ensure no number gets combined in the file.
