STUDENTS: When you run the simulator via "make test" or similar,
you will see a command line generated by the makefile that looks like this:

MSG cmd line: ['fcfs.py', '2', '4', '110000', '12345', '2'], usage USAGE: python THISFILE.py NUMCONTEXTS NUMFASTIO SIMTIME SEED|None LOGLEVEL

A log level of 2 logs all of the simulation state changes and your code's msg()
calls, but it does not flush output prematurely. Flushing output a lot makes
the simulation run *really slowly*, but it is necessary if your simulation
crashes and you discover msg() messages missing from the log file. A crash
may kill an output buffer from Pythin. Flushing output buffers avoids that
problem, at the cost of extremely slow execution, so don't flush unless you
need to debug a crash and find that your debugging msg()s are missing.
To increase the log level for flushing, change this line in the makefile:
SIMLOGLEVEL = 2
to this:
SIMLOGLEVEL = 3
Change it back when you are done debugging to get the speed back.
