CSC 421 - Web-Based Software Design and Development
Dr. Dylan Schwesinger
Kutztown University
Fall 2017

This course introduces the students to web-based software design. Using object-oriented techniques, the students will learn how to develop mainly on the client side of event-based web applications. Projects will build rudimentary knowledge of event-based design, and then expand upon those foundations to create web-based software and to add multimedia enhancements, including audio, video, and animation. The completion of projects using these features is an integral part of the course.
