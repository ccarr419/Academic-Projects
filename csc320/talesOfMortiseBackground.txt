* A village(not named) secluded from most troubles is where the story starts off.
* An evil wizard(not named) moves to the outskirts of the town and creates a tower.
* Villagers are frightened by the spire in the distance but do not immediately panic.
* As time goes by their torment will soon be realized.
* The villagers start entering a never ending sleep, yet they still live.
* The villagers believe it is the work of the wizard of the tower but they are too fearful to act on their own.
* Seeking help in any way possible, they send out flyers for a hero for hire appear around the country.
* The hero of the story, fresh off a previous adventure stumbles upon the flyer

* The hero enters the tower, bewildered by the fact of its unguarded yet unwelcome nature.
* They feel as though they have been expected.
* In the main corridor waits the wizard, he has been expecting the hero.
* Startled, the  hero ask who the wizard is
* The wizard says, "My name is of little importance. It is you however, that I am interested in."

* "Your adventurous heart and couragous soul is exactly what I need." Says the wizard
* "I do not understand. What happened to the villagers?" Says the hero
* "I knew they would come asking questions but not dare come themselves."
* "They are too weak, too fearful, they needed a hero." Said the wizard
* Choosing the remain silent, the hero let the wizard continue.
* "So I preyed on the frail villagers so that a hero like yourself would arrive." Said the wizard
* "So you put all those villagers in a never ending sleep?" Said the hero
* "Yes but they were just pawns, inconsiquential to the real work at hand"
* "You are the real prize, the final puzzle piece" Said the wizard
* "You won't get away with this!" Says the hero - Draws weapon
* Unflinchingly the wizard continues, "With your soul I can power my magic one hundredfold"

OBJECTIVE: Find a way to release your soul from the book and the souls of the villagers by going
from chapter to chapter and different fairy tales.

BACKGROUND: To find an exit from the book you must the mystic, enchanted book at the end of
every chapter. This will act as a porthole to the next chapter. Each chapter has been corrupted by
the wizard's magic and thus is full of monsters, traps, and puzzles. However his magic has also
created tears in each story that you can use to your advantage to write things into the story to
help you along the way. Each story is modeled after a real life fairy tale where the setting, monsters,
traps, puzzles, protagonist, antagonist, people, music, etc. take inspiration from. Trapped villagers
believe they have been trapped for years or decades because time moves incredible slower on the outside.
When spoken to, the villagers have no recollection of how they got there, but offer help all the same.
Helpful characters from each fairy tale have no notion of the outside world but do know something
weird is happening and will help you in anyway they can or may need some incentive.

EPILOGUE: The hero escapes from the book only to discover that little time has past since they
were trapped. Their body still lies where it was when they were trapped. The hero and the wizard
commence in one final battle. The hero defeats the wizard and traps him inside his own book. He
then releases the the villagers who were trapped. All the villagers make their way to the tower
to congratulate the hero and thank them for their service. Everyone leaves the tower to celebrate.
The book that the wizard was trapped in glows sligtly and the pages begin to flutter. A barely
audible evil laugh in the background can be heard and the book closes. Fade to black. Game over.
