Notes:

* Due to an underestimate of the time required to implement this project and 
	only the week of actual work-time on my behalf it is regrettable that 
	the error checking part of this project was never implemented. 
	I began to write the code and plan everything out on paper
	for the error checking but time and an unforeseen error (below) has 
	prevented it from being continued and implemented.
	
* With the previous note said, everything works to the best of my awareness
	besides the error checking
	
Error found while trying to implement error checking:
* raised STORAGE_ERROR : stack overflow (or erroneous memory access)

Notes on error:
* I know this error was related to the error checking because as soon as I
	erased the procedure calls to the error checking procedure, this error
	stopped. I have not debugged the error checking part of the project
	due to the lack of time, which is also regrettable.
