My new way of writing text is
great. You can just keep reading
without having to go back to
the start of the line all the
time.

Are You kidding?! Reading like this is
kind of difficult. Sure, you can read
individual words O.K., but it's kind
of hard to follow the text when half
the lines go backward. Plus, I kind of
like reading the'old way'. It gave
me a chance to rest while my eyes
were going back to the start of a
line.
