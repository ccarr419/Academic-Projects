Spring 2018

This course introduces the concepts of object-oriented programming languages, object-oriented analysis and design, and design patterns, and demonstrates their use in the development of an object-oriented implementation of a major project. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is used to develop the project's design and implementation. A current programming language is used throughout the course to illustrate major concepts and implement the project.
